### printf("Hello!\n");

Computer Science & Engineering undergraduate, deeply interested in abstract mathematics, philosophy and the foundations of computation. I write mostly in Haskell, Lean, LaTeX and C/++. I enjoy reading technical books. Endlessly curious â€” building understanding one system at a time.
