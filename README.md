### printf("Hello!\n");
Computer Science and Engineering undergrad autodidact, wannabe philosopher and mathematician. Intellectual things I can do: philosophy, mathematics, linguistics, biology, physics, computer science, and so on... Too many hobbies, not enough time. I put effort into the things I undertake to do to get at least a minimum of entertainment.
